## 🧠 Aim
To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT to organize daily tasks and demonstrate how outputs evolve from simple prompts to advanced and interactive prompt designs.

---

## ⚙️ AI Tools Required
- **ChatGPT (GPT-5 or equivalent LLM)**  
- **Python / Flask** *(optional – for user interface)*  
- **Google Sheets / Notion** *(for data tracking, optional)*  
- **Command-line / Chat Interface** *(for simulation and testing)*

## 📘 Explanation
Prompt engineering uses clarity, context, and structure to get accurate outputs from AI models.
When prompts are vague, the system provides general answers, but detailed prompts generate task-specific, prioritized, and contextual outputs.  
In this experiment, ChatGPT works as:  
  1) Study Time Scheduler  
  2) Project Task Breakdown Assistant  
  3) Personal Budget Manager  
  4) Travel Itinerary Planner  
  5) Adaptive Personal Guide based on refined prompts  

The experiment highlights how better prompt design leads to improved planning and decision-making.

## 🧭 Procedure
1. Identify the personal tasks the assistant needs to handle.    
2. Frame basic, intermediate, and advanced prompts for each task.     
3. Interact with the LLM and observe the results of each prompt.    
4. Refine the prompts to improve detail and personalization.    
5. (Optional) Store user preferences to simulate adaptive learning.

## 💬 Prompt Design and Outputs

### 🔹 Prompt 1 – Basic Prompt
**Prompt:**  
> “List three study activities I should focus on today.”  

**Output:**  
1. Revise your lecture notes.   
2. Complete pending assignments.    
3. Practice two programming problems.  

---

### 🔹 Prompt 2 – Intermediate Prompt
**Prompt:**  
> “Create a study time scheduler that arranges my tasks based on difficulty level and available time.”  

**Output:**  
- High Difficulty: Practice coding problems (6 PM – 7 PM)  
- Medium Difficulty: Complete assignments (4 PM – 5 PM)  
- Low Difficulty: Revise notes (3 PM – 3:30 PM)  
- Summary: Total planned time is 2.5 hours.  

---

### 🔹 Prompt 3 – Advanced Prompt
**Prompt:**  
> “Build an advanced personal assistant that manages study schedules, breaks down project tasks, plans budgets, prepares travel itineraries, and adapts to my preferences.”

**Output:**   
- **Task Manager:** Automatically arranges study sessions and inserts short breaks.   
  - Example: You have free time at 6 PM. Shall I schedule coding practice?  
- **Project Breakdown:** Splits a project into goals, weekly milestones, and deliverables.  
  - Example: Week 1 – Requirements, Week 2 – Prototype, Week 3 – Testing.  
- **Budget Manager:** Organizes expenses into categories and tracks overspending.  
  - Example: Your food expense crossed the weekly limit. Reduce by 10 percent.  
- **Travel Planner:** Creates a day-wise travel itinerary.  
  - Example: Day 1 – City tour, Day 2 – Museum visit, Day 3 – Beach sunset.
